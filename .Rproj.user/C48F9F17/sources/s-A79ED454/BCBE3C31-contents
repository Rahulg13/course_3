# **INTRODUCTION**
The code in run_analysis.R tries to accomplish the project objectives in following steps : 

## **Reading variable names**

It reads the variable names from feature.txt file. 
These variable names are utilized later to name the columns.
## **Reading activity labels**
It reads the activity label names to perform the task 3 in the project requirements.

## **Reading the data**
It is accomplished in following steps 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#To create the numbered lists 
```
1. Reading the txt file through readLines() function
2. Using strsplit() function to separate values
3. Using unlist() to transform list values into a data frame()
4. Names are assigned to columns
5. Data for activity and participants are read
6. Cbind is used to collate the test data

## Similar procedure is used to collate training data.

## **Mean and standard deviations**
Grep() function is used to identify mean variables within the variables and their
values are found out

## **Descriptive names**
Descriptive activity names are assigned using the labels created earlier

## **Tidy data creation**
Finally, tapply is used to find mean values grouped by activity and subject. The factors
used in tapply are activity and subjects in column 1 and 2 respectively.
